# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains customer demographics, subscription details, payment methods, and churn status.

## Dataset
- **Filename:** customer_churn_data.csv
- **Features:**
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Subscription_Length_Months`, `Monthly_Charges`, `Total_Charges`
  - `Contract_Type`, `Payment_Method`, `Customer_Support_Calls`
  - `Churn` (Target Variable: 1 = Churn, 0 = No Churn)

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Exploration** – Checking for missing values and understanding churn distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data.
3. **Model Training** – Training a Random Forest classifier to predict churn.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset and notebook.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`).
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to understand the analysis and model performance.

## Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in predicting customer churn.
- Identified key factors influencing churn through EDA.
